This is where you put custom/non-core content.

The folder is called GameModes because it's the home of the would-be Career Mode data, if you have access to it.

Do not store any assets directly in this folder, create a subfolder for the specific game mode/mod you are making.

All scripts in a game mode/mode must be in their own script assembly!!!
